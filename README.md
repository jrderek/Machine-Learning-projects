# Machine-Learning-projects

 Introduction
In most cases machine learning gets limited to the same call, fit, predict loop. Whereas ML is actually much more than that. This repository will be a place containing multiple ML projects which involves all the steps starting from data collection to final model deployment. Each of the projects have a separate readme file attached to them which will be explaining the steps to follow for recreating the project on your own system.
